# Dental Implants

The buzz around implant dentistry is true: Implants are the new standard of care for treatment of edentulism (missing teeth). Forest Family Dentistry believes that if and your loved ones has lost one tooth, several teeth, or all of their teeth, implants are the way to go. Essentially, an implant is a prosthetic tooth made from materials that safely integrate with your natural jaw bones. This advance in dental technology allows dentists and oral surgeons to restore people’s smiles with extraordinary results that last longer than almost anything in dentistry. At Forest Family Dentistry, we have a team of dental professionals that can determine if implants are the best option for you. Dr. Robin Bethell is continually training to be able to provide you with affordable dental implant options to give you your healthiest, most confident smile.

## Dental Implants:

A dental implant is an artificial tooth root that is placed into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. Dental implants may be an option for people who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason.

## Types of Dental Implants

* Endosteal (in the bone): This is the most commonly used type of implant. The various types include screws, cylinders or blades surgically placed into the jawbone. Each implant holds one or more prosthetic teeth. This type of implant is generally used as an alternative for patients with bridges or removable dentures.
* Subperiosteal (on the bone): These are placed on top of the jaw with the metal framework’s posts protruding through the gum to hold the prosthesis. These types of implants are used for patients who are unable to wear conventional dentures and who have minimal bone height.

## Are You a Candidate for Dental Implants?

The ideal candidate for a dental implant is in good general and oral health. Adequate bone in your jaw is needed to support the implant, and the best candidates have healthy gum tissues that are free of periodontal disease.​

Dental implants are intimately connected with the gum tissues and underlying bone in the mouth. Since periodontists are the dental experts who specialize in precisely these areas, they are ideal members of your dental implant team. Not only do periodontists have experience working with other dental professionals, they also have the special knowledge, training and facilities that you need to have teeth that look and feel just like your own. Your dentist and periodontist will work together to make your dreams come true.

## What is a Dental Implant Procedure Like?

This procedure is a team effort between you, your dentist and your periodontist. Your periodontist and dentist will consult with you to determine where and how your implant should be placed. Depending on your specific condition and the type of implant chosen, your periodontist will create a treatment plan tailored to meet your needs.

* Replacing A Single Tooth If you are missing a single tooth, one implant and a crown can replace it.
* Replacing Several Teeth: If you are missing several teeth, implant-supported bridges can replace them.
* Replacing All of Your TeethIf you are missing all of your teeth, an implant-supported full bridge or full denture can replace them.
* Sinus Augmentation A key to implant success is the quantity and quality of the bone where the implant is to be placed. The upper back jaw has traditionally been one of the most difficult areas to successfully place dental implants due to insufficient bone quantity and quality and the close proximity to the sinus. Sinus augmentation can help correct this problem by raising the sinus floor and developing bone for the placement of dental implants.
* Ridge Modification Deformities in the upper or lower jaw can leave you with inadequate bone in which to place dental implants. To correct the problem, the gum is lifted away from the ridge to expose the bony defect. The defect is then filled with bone or bone substitute to build up the ridge. Ridge modification has been shown to greatly improve appearance and increase your chances for successful implants that can last for years to come.

## What Can I Expect After Receiving a Dental Implant?

As you know, your own teeth require conscientious at-home oral care and regular dental visits. Dental implants are like your own teeth and will require the same care. In order to keep your implant clean and plaque-free, brushing and flossing still apply!

After treatment, your periodontist will work closely with you and your dentist to develop the best care plan for you. Periodic follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor your implant, teeth and gums to make sure they are healthy.
