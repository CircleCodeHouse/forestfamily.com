# Oral Surgery and Wisdom Teeth

These two words can send shivers down the spine of anyone who has had their “wisdom teeth” removed. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be bad. With the help of modern sedation techniques, adequate anesthesia, and a very open, happy environment, basic surgeries can be easy! This means you can take care of more of your healthcare needs under one “foresty” roof. However, if your needs are a bit more complex, Dr. Bethell can refer you to an excellent Austin Oral Surgeon (like [Dr. Kern](http://www.yelp.com/biz/travis-w-kern-dds-md-austin-2)!) At Forest Family Dentistry, we will make sure that you are in the best care possible.
